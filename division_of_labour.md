## Log

When you are finished with your part, you can write down the info that the person working on the next part needs here. Specifically the info about the input file for the next part is important: those are the "tick marks" so to speak. The next person should not *read* any files they are not working on, but things such as dimensions of the dataset can be inferred of course. So what you write down as "tick marks" hand makes sure that the next person can continue, and you can give your own take on that.
